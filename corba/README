README:
  This file should be located at the top of the corba Mercurial repository.

  See http://openjdk.java.net/ for more information about the OpenJDK.

  See ../README-builds.html for complete details on build machine requirements.

Super Simple Build Instructions:

    cd make && gnumake
     
  The files that will be imported into the jdk build will be in the "dist"
  directory.                

I am making modifications to this file.
